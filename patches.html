    <h1>SUBTERFUGUE Patches</h1>

    <h3>Kernel Patch</h3>

    <p>
      As of Linux 2.3.39, a patch is required in order to run SUBTERFUGUE.
      With any luck, it might be incorporated for 2.4.  The patch should work
      down to at least 2.3.35, and might even work on 2.2.x with adjustments.

    <ul>
      <li><a href="ptrace-subterfugue-2.3.39.patch.gz">patch for kernel 2.3.39</a>
      <li><a href="ptrace-subterfugue-2.3.42.patch.gz">patch for kernel 2.3.42</a>
      <li><a href="ptrace-subterfugue-2.3.48.patch.gz">patch for kernel 2.3.48</a> 
	[The last two chunks listed below were merged into 2.3.48 (!), so this
	patch is shorter.]
    </ul>

    <p>
      Here are the changes included in the patch.  Most are fairly innocuous
      extensions, but the first two might break some things.

      <ol>

      <li>The exit_code reported during PTRACE_SYSCALL stops now has its high
	bit (0x80) set, to distinguish it from signal stops.  Unfortunately,
	this breaks <a
	href="http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~wichert/strace/"><tt>strace</tt></a>,
	and probably any other program that uses PTRACE_SYSCALL (see
	ptrace(2)).  The fix is pretty simple--just mask off the high bit (or
	adapt the program to make use of the extra information).  A <a
	href="strace-trap.patch.gz">patch</a> is available that does this for
	strace.  (It doesn't appear that <tt>gdb</tt> is affected.)

      <li>When a new child is created (i.e., with clone, fork, or vfork), and
	the child is being traced (e.g., it's done a PTRACE_TRACEME), it will
	now report to the correct parent.  Without this patch, for most cases,
	the wrong parent is being reported to.  This patch is correct, but it
	opens up what some would consider a security hole--a malicious child
	might unexpectedly invoke PTRACE_TRACEME, causing it to report to a
	waiting parent process that never expected to hear from it.  This was
	discussed on linux-kernel for a bit; there didn't seem to be a
	consensus about whether this was even a hole at all.

      <li>A new ptrace command PTRACE_GETPPID is implemented, which lets a
	tracing process discover the original parent of a traced child.  This
	information is otherwise unavailable.

      <li>A new wait flag __WALL is implemented, to allow clone and non-clone
	children to be waited for simultaneously.

      <li>Exits of the system calls fork, vfork, and clone are now reported.

      </ol>
