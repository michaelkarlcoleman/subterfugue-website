    <h1>SUBTERFUGUE Patches</h1>

    <h3>Kernel Patch</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Good News:</strong> As of Linux 2.3.99-pre1, SUBTERFUGUE can be
      run without this patch; the <tt>--waitchannelhack</tt> flag must be used
      in this case.  The patch below is still recommended, though; as
      SUBTERFUGUE will run significantly slower without it.

    <p>
      For kernels prior to 2.3.99-pre1, a patch is required in order to run
      SUBTERFUGUE.  We're working on getting the required features
      incorporated for 2.4 (as the progression of patches shows).  The 2.3.39
      patch should work down to at least 2.3.35, and might even work on 2.2.x
      with adjustments.

    <ul>
      <li><a href="ptrace-subterfugue-2.3.39.patch.gz">patch for kernel 2.3.39</a>
      <li><a href="ptrace-subterfugue-2.3.42.patch.gz">patch for kernel 2.3.42</a>
      <li><a href="ptrace-subterfugue-2.3.48.patch.gz">patch for kernel 2.3.48</a> 
	[The last two chunks listed below were merged into 2.3.48 (!), so this
	patch is shorter.]
      <li><a href="ptrace-subterfugue-2.3.51.patch.gz">patch for kernel 2.3.51</a> 
	[This patch requires SUBTERFUGUE 0.1.2 or later, and includes only
	chunks for the first two items (GETPPID is no longer needed).  This
	patch is backward compatible with existing versions of strace--the
	strace patch below isn't required (and won't work) with this patch.]
      <li><a href="ptrace-subterfugue-2.3.99-pre1.patch.gz">patch for kernel 2.3.99-pre1</a> 
	[This patch requires SUBTERFUGUE 0.1.2 or later, and includes only
	chunks for the first item (the second change was merged in
	2.3.99-pre1).  As above, this patch is backward compatible with
	existing versions of strace--the strace patch below isn't required
	(and won't work) with this patch.]
    </ul>

    <p>
      Here are the changes included in the patch.  Most are fairly innocuous
      extensions, but the first two might break some things.

      <ol>

      <li>The exit_code reported during PTRACE_SYSCALL stops now has its high
	bit (0x80) set, to distinguish it from signal stops.  Unfortunately,
	this breaks <a
	href="http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~wichert/strace/"><tt>strace</tt></a>,
	and probably any other program that uses PTRACE_SYSCALL (see
	ptrace(2)).  The fix is pretty simple--just mask off the high bit (or
	adapt the program to make use of the extra information).  A <a
	href="strace-trap.patch.gz">patch</a> is available that does this for
	strace.  (It doesn't appear that <tt>gdb</tt> is affected.)

      <li>When a new child is created (i.e., with clone, fork, or vfork), and
	the child is being traced (e.g., it's done a PTRACE_TRACEME), it will
	now report to the correct parent.  Without this patch, for most cases,
	the wrong parent is being reported to.  This patch is correct, but it
	opens up what some would consider a security hole--a malicious child
	might unexpectedly invoke PTRACE_TRACEME, causing it to report to a
	waiting parent process that never expected to hear from it.  This was
	discussed on linux-kernel for a bit; there didn't seem to be a
	consensus about whether this was even a hole at all.  (Update: Merged
	in 2.3.99-pre1.)

      <li>A new ptrace command PTRACE_GETPPID is implemented, which lets a
	tracing process discover the original parent of a traced child.  This
	information is otherwise unavailable.  (Update: As of about 2.3.51,
	this info will be available in <tt>/proc</tt>.)

      <li>A new wait flag __WALL is implemented, to allow clone and non-clone
	children to be waited for simultaneously.  (Update: Merged in 2.3.48.)

      <li>Exits of the system calls fork, vfork, and clone are now reported.
	(Update: Merged in 2.3.48.)

      </ol>
