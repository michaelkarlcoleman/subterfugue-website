      <h1>SUBTERFUGUE Tutorial</h1>

      <h3>Invoking SUBTERFUGUE</h3>

      <p>
	The SUBTERFUGUE driver is called "sf", and an invocation might look
	like this

      <blockquote>
	  <tt>
	    sf --trick=Trace:'call=["open", "close"]' cp filea fileb
	  </tt>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	This runs the command "cp filea fileb" under the influence of one
	Trace trick.  The text that follows the colon in a trick option is
	Python code used to pass options to the trick.  In this case, a single
	option "call" is set to a value which is a list consisting of two
	strings ("open" and "close").  The single quote characters here
	merely protect the construct from being interpreted by the shell.

      <p>
	It's up to each trick to determine which options it looks for and what
	values are acceptible.  The code to set options can be more involved;
	the above, for example, could have been written this way

      <blockquote>
	  <tt>
	    --trick=Trace:'_a=["open"]; _b=["close"]; call=_a + _b'	
	  </tt>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	The "-h" flag can be used to get "sf" usage information.  You can
	combine the "-h" flag with "--trick" options to get usage information
	about one or more tricks.

      <p>
	Multiple tricks can be specified in an sf command.  In this case, the
	leftmost trick gets the first shot at any system call.  The second
	leftmost trick then gets the next shot, if the leftmost trick didn't
	annul the call, and so on.  Each successive trick sees the call as it
	is passed, so, for example, if the first trick rewrites a call
	"sleep(1)" to "sleep(10)", then as far as the second trick is
	concerned, it sees only that the process is invoking "sleep(10)".  A
	similar chaining process applies to system call results and signals.

      <p>
	The sf command looks for tricks in the "tricks" subdirectory of its
	installation directory, but additional locations can be added by
	setting the environment variable TRICKPATH to a list of directories
	(&agrave; la PATH).

      <p>
	Unless the "--failnice" flag is given, sf will attempt to SIGKILL all
	of its children if it (or a trick) has to abort for any reason.  This
	is to prevent the child processes from continuing on uncontrolled
	(which is what happens if "--filenice" is specified).

      <h3>Writing New Tricks</h3>

      <p>
	In this section, we'll walk through a series of increasingly powerful
	and complicated tricks, in order to demonstrate and explain the trick
	interface.  (If you're interested in a terse description of the
	interface, see <tt>Trick.py</tt>.)

      <h4>Delay</h4>

      <p>
	This first trick is probably the simplest useful trick.  Here is the
	code, from DelayTrick.py

      <blockquote>
	  <pre>
from Trick import Trick

import time


class Delay(Trick):
    def usage(self):
        return """
        Puts a delay before each system call.  The 'delay' parameter specifies
        the delay in seconds (as a float).  The default delay is one second.
"""
    
    def __init__(self, options):
        self._delay = options.get('delay', 1)

    def callbefore(self, pid, call, args):
        time.sleep(self._delay)
	  </pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	Like all tricks, this trick inherits from the base class Trick, which
	provides default versions of any methods we don't define in our trick.
	The usage method simply returns an explanatory string that sf can
	display to the user.  (To save space, we'll skip the usage method and
	import statements for the rest of the tricks.)

      <p>
	The trick constructor, "__init__", is run during sf startup and is
	passed an argument "options" which is a dictionary holding the trick's
	command-line options.

      <p>
	The method "callbefore" is called before each system call (subject to
	the call mask, which we describe later).  In this trick, this method
	just sleeps for the specified amount of time, which has the effect of
	delaying each system call.

      <p>
	This trick is very simple, but already we're able to do something not
	possible with available tools.


      <h4>Count</h4>

      <p>
	This trick counts the system calls invoked by and signals received by
	each process, and reports these statistics after the command finishes.
	In this trick, we see two new methods: "signal", which is called for
	every delivered signal, and "cleanup", which is called once after all
	processes have terminated.

      <p>
	More of the information available is being used here.  The argument
	'pid' is the process id of the process in question, and 'call' and
	'signal' are the names of the system call or signal, respectively,
	that is occurring.

      <blockquote>
	  <pre>
class Count(Trick):
    def __init__(self, options):
        self.callcount = {}
        self.sigcount = {}

    def callbefore(self, pid, call, args):
        if not self.callcount.has_key(pid):
            self.callcount[pid] = {}
        self.callcount[pid][call] = self.callcount[pid].get(call, 0) + 1

    def signal(self, pid, signal):
        if not self.sigcount.has_key(pid):
            self.sigcount[pid] = {}
        self.sigcount[pid][signal] = self.sigcount[pid].get(signal, 0) + 1

    def cleanup(self):
        for pid in self.callcount.keys():
            print 'process %s\n' % pid
            for call, count in self.callcount[pid].items():
                print '%6d\t%s' % (count, call)
            if self.sigcount.has_key(pid):
                print ''
                for sig, count in self.sigcount[pid].items():
                    print '%6d\t%s' % (count, sig)
            print '\n'
	  </pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	Here is the output from its use with the 'date' command.

      <blockquote>
	  <pre>
bash-2.03$ sf --tri=Count date
Wed Feb  2 01:10:22 CST 2000
process 8634

     1	personality
     4	fstat
     4	open
     1	_exit
     4	close
     1	time
     1	getpid
     4	brk
     1	ioctl
     3	munmap
     1	write
     1	mprotect
     6	mmap
     4	read
	  </pre>
      </blockquote>


      <h4>ThrottleIO</h4>

      <p>
	This trick throttles I/O (that done by the read and write system
	calls) by sleeping before each read and write for a duration depending
	on the number of bytes to be written and the I/O rate limit.

      <blockquote>
	  <pre>
class ThrottleIO(Trick):
    def __init__(self, options):
        if options.has_key('bps'):
            self.bps = options['bps']
        else:
            sys.exit("error: %s: option required" % self.__class__.__name__)

    def callbefore(self, pid, call, args):
        time.sleep(float(args[2]) / self.bps)
        
    def callmask(self):
        return { 'read' : 1, 'write' : 1 }
	  </pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	There are several new things to note here.  A new method, callmask, is
	defined.  This method determines which system calls cause the methods
	callbefore and callafter to be invoked.  callmask returns a
	dictionary, each key of which is the name of a system call to be
	traced; it can also just return None (the Python null value), which
	means that all system calls are traced (this is the default if no
	callmask method is defined).  There is a corresponding method called
	signalmask, which determines which signals are traced.

      <p>
	The 'args' argument of callbefore holds the sequence of arguments to
	the system call.  In this case, the third argument of read and write
	is examined to determine how many bytes are being read or written.

      <p>
	Finally, we see that sys.exit is being used to abort sf if something
	goes wrong.


      <h4>NetFail</h4>

      <p>
	This trick causes connect calls to fail.  This can be used to keep a
	program from accessing the network.

      <blockquote>
	  <pre>
class NetFail(Trick):
    def callbefore(self, pid, call, args):
        subcall = args[0]
        if subcall == 3:                # SYS_CONNECT
            return (None, -errno.EHOSTUNREACH, None, None)
        else:
            return (subcall, None, None, None)

    def callafter(self, pid, call, result, state):
        assert state != 3

    def callmask(self):
        return { 'socketcall' : 1 }
	  </pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	In this trick we are exposed to a bit of ugliness in the Linux kernel.
	Although the network calls (socket, bind, connect, etc.) are normally
	thought of as distinct system calls, in current Linux kernels they
	are all multiplexed together into one call named "socketcall".  The
	first argument determines which subcall is being performed--an
	argument of '3', for example, corresponds to a connect call.

      <p>
	When a connect call is performed we see that a four-tuple is returned
	whose second element is "-errno.EHOSTUNREACH".  When a tuple is
	returned from callbefore and its second element is not None, the call
	is annulled and the second element returned as its result.  In this
	case we are causing the call to fail with error result EHOSTUNREACH;
	the value is negated because that is the kernel's convention for
	returning error codes.

      <p>
	If a non-connect case of socketcall occurs, this callbefore method
	returns a four-tuple whose first argument is the subcall number.  Any
	Python object may be passed back as a first argument in this case;
	such an object will be passed to the callafter method as its state
	argument.  This provides a means for a callbefore invocation to pass
	data to the corresponding callafter call.  In this case, we're just
	double-checking that the callafter method is never invoked for the
	connect case; it's never invoked because it is always annulled
	instead, as described above.


      <h4>Rot13</h4>

      <p>
	This trick causes output done with the write system call to be
	rot13-translated.  (In a rot13 translation, each letter is replaced
	with its thirteenth successor, wrapping around if necessary.)  This
	could be used to improve the security of a program, even if you don't
	have source code for it.  Okay--that was just a little joke.

      <p>
	This trick makes use of the Memory class.  Each instance of Memory is
	an abstraction that represents the memory space of a particular
	process.  The callbefore method retrieves the particular memory object
	associated with the current process and uses it to do a "peek" to get
	the data that is about to be written.  (Note how the address and size
	of the data is taken from the arguments to the write system call.)
	The data is then transformed and written back into the process'
	memory.  

      <p>
	One of the conditions that makes this work is that the data we're
	writing back is the same size as what was originally there.  If we
	were writing a larger string, we would have to do this in a different
	way, or risk smashing the stack or causing an error by writing to a
	page not present in the process' memory space.  (We address this
	problem in the next section.)

      <p>
	Note that the original data needs to be restored after the system
	call.  The calling program will not expect a write call to change the
	data written, and if this is done, the program may very well act
	erroneously or crash.  How is the data restored?  If the "poke" call
	is given a third argument (which is always "self", the current trick),
	the poked data is restored after the corresponding callafter method
	has completed.  So, if the third argument is given, the poke is only
	temporary; otherwise, it is permanent.

      <blockquote>
	  <pre>
trans = string.maketrans('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ',
                         'nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM')

class Rot13(Trick):
    def callbefore(self, pid, call, args):
        m = getMemory(pid)
        address = args[1]
        size = args[2]
        data = m.peek(address, size)
        m.poke(address, string.translate(data, trans), self)

    def callmask(self):
        return { 'write' : 1 }
	  </pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	Here is the output from a couple of uses of this trick:

      <blockquote>
	  <pre>
bash-2.03$ sf --tri=Rot13 date
Jrq Sro  2 02:55:34 PFG 2000
bash-2.03$ sf --tri=Rot13 --tri=Rot13 date
Wed Feb  2 02:55:37 CST 2000
	  </pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	Note in particular how applying the trick twice causes the effect to
	cancel out (two rotations of 13 is equivalent to a rotation of 26,
	which is equivalent to no rotation).  This is an example of how tricks
	can be composed for a combined effect.

      <p>
	For just rewriting stdout, this trick is markedly inferior to the
	simpler

      <blockquote>
	  <pre>
date | tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M
	  </pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	It does show, though, how the user can exert control over program
	output even when the program was not written to support this (as in
	the case where output is sent directly to a named file).


      <h4>LineDisclaimer</h4>

      <p>
	You work at MegaSilly CCA, and the legal department there has decided
	that henceforth each line of all program output ought to have its own
	copyright statement.  Since hacking SUBTERFUGUE sounds like more fun
	than arguing with legal, you set to work, producing the following
	trick.  (For simplicity, this trick just adds a disclaimer at the end
	of each write, whether or not it ends a line.)

      <blockquote>
	  <pre>
disclaimer = """Copyright (C) %s  MegaSilly CCA.  All rights reserved.
""" % gmtime(time())[0]

class LineDisclaimer(Trick):
    def callbefore(self, pid, call, args):
        "append disclaimer bytes to the end of each write"
        m = getMemory(pid)
        address = args[1]
        size = args[2]
        data = m.peek(address, size)
        area, asize = m.areas()[0]
        newsize = size + len(disclaimer)
        if newsize <= asize:
            m.poke(area, data + disclaimer, self)
            return (size, None, None, (args[0], area, newsize))

    def callafter(self, pid, call, result, state):
        "don't let program see that we wrote extra bytes"
        if state != None and result > state:
            return state

    def callmask(self):
        return { 'write' : 1 }
	  </pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	This produces output like this

      <blockquote>
	  <pre>
bash-2.03$ sf --tri=LineDisclaimer date
Thu Feb  3 00:24:19 CST 2000
Copyright (C) 2000  MegaSilly CCA.  All rights reserved.
	  </pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
	In this trick we are changing each write call to make it write out a
	longer string than the program originally intended.  This makes things
	trickier, because, as we discussed above, we can't just tack the extra
	bytes on in place.  Instead, we poke the new, longer string elsewhere
	in memory.

      <p>
	The "areas" method of Memory provides a list of writable memory areas
	that we might use as scratchpad space.  In this simple implementation,
	we just use the first available area.  The write call argument list is
	modified so that the address and length to be written are those of the
	new string.  We also pass the original size of the write through the
	state argument; if the write is successful, this is passed back as the
	result of the call so that the program doesn't see that we've written
	extra bytes.  The callafter method shows how we can make the call
	return a different value than the one returned by the kernel.

      <p>
	This simple implementation has a couple of problems.  Under some
	conditions, only a partial write will be done.  If the partial write
	is such that the original string is written plus part of the
	disclaimer, it would be nice if we could cause the rest of the
	disclaimer to be written out.  We can't really do this reliably,
	though, unless we can replace one write with multiple write calls.
	(This capability will probably be added in a future version of
	SUBTERFUGUE.)

      <p>
	Another problem is that overwriting arbitrary memory is dangerous if
	the process shares that memory with another process (or it is mmap-ed
	to a file).  This problem will also be addressed in the future.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>
	Hopefully this tutorial has given you a sense of what SUBTERFUGUE is
	capable of.  It's not a catholicon (a panacea)--some problems can only
	be solved partially or with excessive cleverness, and others not at
	all.  It does, though, provide new means of solving problems; the goal
	is for it to become an additional useful tool in the hacker's bag of
	tricks.
