      <h1>Detailed SUBTERFUGUE Description</h1>

      <h3>What is SUBTERFUGUE?</h3>

      <p>
	SUBTERFUGUE is a framework for observing and playing with the reality of
	Linux processes (i.e., what they see and do via their system call and
	signal interfaces.)  This is done with <em>tricks</em>, which are
	components that watch and possibly modify a program's actions for a
	specific purpose.

      <p>
	SUBTERFUGUE comes with several tricks.  One, called <em>Trace</em>,
	watches a program and produces output similar to strace(1).  Another,
	<em>ThrottleIO</em>, restricts the total (average) I/O rate of a
	process.  The most substantial trick, <em>SimplePathSandbox</em>,
	restricts the parts of the filesystem that a process (and its progeny)
	are allowed to read to and write from.

      <p>
	Tricks can generally be composed to produce a combined effect.  So,
	for example, ThrottleIO could be combined with SimplePathSandbox to
	restrict I/O rate and path access, or a SimplePathSandbox could be
	sandwiched between two Trace tricks in order to observe the changes in
	the flow of system calls that SimplePathSandbox is making.  Some trick
	combinations will not work, though, because they have contrary
	purposes or interfering implementations.

      <p>
	SUBTERFUGUE is meant to be extended with new tricks.  A base class,
	<tt>Trick</tt>, provides the trick interface; new tricks can inherit
	directly from the base class or be derived from other existing tricks.
	Using the interface, a trick can modify the arguments of a system call
	(or even the call itself), change the result of the call, or skip the
	call entirely.  Similarly, signals can be skipped or modified, and
	tricks are notified when processes terminate.  Process memory can also
	be changed, permanently or just for the duration of a call.

      <p>
	In order to do its work, SUBTERFUGUE must carefully monitor process
	creation and termination.  The wait system call must also be carefully
	emulated, since ptrace disrupts the normal wait reporting mechanism.
	SUBTERFUGUE tries hard to get the details right, but problems remain.


      <h3>Limitations</h3>

      SUBTERFUGUE has a number of known limitations and caveats (not to mention
      bugs).  Some problems are due to the current implementation or the
      limitations of the ptrace interface.  Other more general problems arise
      from the way that the Linux kernel works or because of the general
      difficulty of controlling program behavior.

      <h4>Implementation Problems</h4>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <em>It's slow.</em> Compared to 'strace', it's perhaps ten times
	  slower, depending upon how system-call-intensive a program is.  As
	  an example, the subjective feel of Netscape Navigator is a little
	  faster than running it on a remote X display over a 28.8 modem.
	  This problem will be improved by optimizing the Python code, by a
	  kernel patch to mask out unneeded process stops, and by moving parts
	  of the Python code to C.  Ultimately, SUBTERFUGUE's speed should be
	  at least as good as strace on average.  The goal of efficiency,
	  though, is secondary--the most important thing is to keep trick
	  writing simple and quick.

	<li>
	  <em>Program behavior can diverge.</em> Under Linux, program behavior
	  can differ while the program is being traced, versus when it is not.
	  One simple example is that <tt>nanosleep</tt> calls are interrupted
	  by ignored signals under tracing, which doesn't happen in the
	  untraced case.  Other instances of divergence are caused by
	  SUBTERFUGUE's tracing techniques.  This may be more important for
	  tricks that want to observe than for those that want to control.
	  The kernel can be changed piecemeal to reduce this problem, but the
	  real answer is probably a better alternative to ptrace.

	<li>
	  <em>Volatile memory changes can cause observation and control
	    failure.</em> If two processes share memory, and one process makes
	    a system call that will read from (or write to) that memory, there
	    is a race wherein the other process can modify the memory between
	    the time SUBTERFUGUE examines it and the kernel actually makes use
	    of it, thus evading the tracer's control.  (A similar problem
	    occurs with mmap-ed hardware.)  There are solutions to this
	    problem, but they will tend to slow things down and increase
	    divergence.  One approach would be to have the tracer stop all
	    other processes sharing memory during the system call transition.
	    Another approach would be to mark the pages "not present", causing
	    the other processes to hang during the race period (this would
	    require a kernel patch).

	<li>
	  <em>It's highly dependent on the kernel system call interface.</em>
	  This is a necessity, but it means that a lot of ugliness (e.g.,
	  socketcall) hidden by libc is exposed to trick writers.  It also means
	  that SUBTERFUGUE will have to carefully track new system calls, and
	  that existing tricks may break due to future kernel changes.

      </ul>

      <h4>General Problems</h4>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <em>Non-root users cannot trace setuid/gid programs.</em> This is
	  disallowed by the kernel in order to maintain the security model of
	  these programs.  It might be possible to re-enable tracing if the
	  setuid program drops its special privileges.  This problem isn't too
	  serious because in the case that we're most interested in, users
	  will have root access to their machines.

	<li>
	  <em>There are limits to the control that can be achieved.</em>  So,
	  for example, a web browser could pass information to an outside host
	  by accessing it in an ideosyncratic way.  This is not detectable in
	  general.
      </ul>


      <h3>Similar Tools</h3>

      <p>
	When I first started thinking about SUBTERFUGUE, I looked around at
	what had been done before; I was hoping that someone had already done
	it so that I wouldn't have to.  <tt>:-)</tt> None of what I found
	seemed to be exactly what I was looking for, though; each had
	different features or goals or lacked an acceptable license.  (I did
	get a lot of ideas, though, from reading strace's source code.)

      <h3>Future Directions</h3>

      <h3>Appendix: The Five Degrees of Process Nescience and Impuissance</h3>

      I find it useful to think about a continuum of process nescience
      (ignorance) and impuissance<a href="#foot">*</a> (powerlessness) with
      regard to observation by a tracing process and a second related
      continuum for control.  Each continuum has two dimensions: the degree to
      which it is affected, and the degree to which it may evade.

      <p>
      <div align="center">
	<table cellspacing="8">
	  <caption>Observation Continuum</caption>
	  <tr><th>Degree</th><th>Effect</th><th>Evasion</th></tr>

	  <tr><td>1</td><td>The process is not observed.</td><td>The process is
	      not monitored.</td></tr>

	  <tr><td>2</td><td>Observation is done in a manner that causes
	      serious disruption, which the process is able to
	      notice.</td><td>The process can easily evade monitoring
	      without intending to do so.</td></tr>

	  <tr><td>3</td><td>Observation is done without serious disruption, but
	      the process is still easily aware of the observation.</td><td>The
	      process can only evade monitoring by intentional action.</td></tr>

	  <tr><td>4</td><td>Observation is not noticeable unless the process
	      takes unusual steps.</td><td>The process can only evade monitoring by
	      taking steps that clearly demonstrate its intent to do so.</td></tr>

	  <tr><td>5</td><td>The process is totally unaware of
	      observation.</td><td>The process cannot evade monitoring.</td></tr>

	</table>
      </div>

      <p>
	The control continuum is similar, except that the effect in question
	is the ability of the tracer to <em>control</em> the process'
	behavior, rather than to merely observe it.
