      <h1>SUBTERFUGUE Motivation</h1>

      <h3>Why SUBTERFUGUE?</h3>

      <p>
	We Unix/Linux users sometimes indulge ourselves in a bit of smugness
	when we read about the incessant wave after wave of viruses that
	plague the hapless legions of Windows users.  To a degree this feeling
	is justified, as the security features of Windows 95/98 are a
	generation behind Unix with respect to this sort of problem.

      <p>
	Our faith in the superiority of Unix security is somewhat misplaced,
	though.  When people think of Unix security problems, they usually
	think of security lapses caused by implementation and administration
	mistakes.  These problems, though, are correctable and not due to
	underlying design flaws.

      <p>
	More serious than these user-versus-root problems are
	user-versus-program problems.  Suppose you download a viewer program
	from Redmond Pandemic, Inc., and run it.  At that point, that program
	can do just about anything that you could with your account.  It can,
	for example

      <ul>
	<li>surreptitiously monitor what you view with the program and report
	back to RPI,
	<li>steal your files, uploading them to the net,
	<li>erase your files,
	<li>make subtle modifications to your files, causing problems you may
	not detect for a long time,
	<li>install rogue programs (e.g., DDoS clients), 
	<li>install Trojan clients in your path to capture your root password,
	or passwords to other machines you have access to,
	<li>send threatening or incriminating email to the FBI,
	<li>download incriminating files (e.g., child pornography) onto your
	computer,
	<li>etc.
      </ul>

      A lot of this you would probably detect eventually, and for some of
      these cases, you might have an action against RPI, assuming that you
      could pinpoint them as the cause.  In the mean time, though, a great
      deal of irreparable harm could occur.

      <p>
	A similar problem is the system administrator's dilemma one might call
	<em>root roulette</em>.  In this situation, the administrator must run
	some program (e.g., an installation program) as root, thereby putting
	their entire system at the mercy of that program.  (This is
	disturbingly similar to the case of Windows users running "run me"
	programs they receive in their email.)

      <p>
	It is theoretically possible to do this safely by disconnecting the
	host from all networks (assuming the program doesn't need a network
	connection), and carefully comparing the state of all files before and
	after the program in question is run to ensure that nothing untoward
	was done.  This is hardly ever practical, though.

      <p>
	So far, problems like these don't seem to be occurring with much
	frequency.  This may be partly due to Linux's limited use as a client
	OS up to this point.

      <p>
	This respite won't last.  There are corporations, entities out there
	that don't see your computer as your property--they see <em>you</em>,
	or at least your behavior while running their software, as
	<em>their</em> property.  We see them pushing, stretching the
	boundaries all the time.  Increases in computing power and network
	bandwidth will make it more tempting for these entities to "borrow"
	part of your computer for their purposes.
	  
      <p>
	<strong>The primary goal of SUBTERFUGUE is to help you keep control of
	your computer.</strong>  It can do this not only by flagging and
	blocking errant program behavior, but also by allowing you to subvert
	the goals of the program in a more general way by controlling its
	reality.

      <p>
	The hoped-for effect of SUBTERFUGUE will be to help shift power away
	from these control thieves and back into your hands.
