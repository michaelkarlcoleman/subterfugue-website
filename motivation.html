      <h1><a href="http://subterfugue.org">SUBTERFUGUE</a> Motivation</h1>

      <h3>Why was SUBTERFUGUE written?</h3>

      <p>
	We users of <a
	href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html">GNU/Linux</a> and
	other Unix-like operating systems (collectively referred to here as
	*nix) sometimes indulge in a bit of smugness when we read about the
	ceaseless wave upon wave of viruses that plague those hapless legions
	of the damned--Microsoft Windows users.  To a degree this feeling is
	justified, as the security features of Windows are a generation behind
	*nix with respect to this sort of problem.

      <p>
	Our faith in the superiority of *nix security is somewhat misplaced,
	though.  For the coming battle, *nix is almost as defenseless as
	scorned Windows.

      <p>
	When people think of *nix security problems, they usually think of
	transitory security lapses caused by implementation and administration
	mistakes, rather than the broken-by-design problems of Windows.
	Historically, security has been thought of as a
	<a name="user-versus-root">user-versus-root</a>
	problem.

      <p>
	Today, though, the user frequently <em>is</em> root (being the owner
	and primary user of his Freenix PC) and faces instead the more
	insidious <a name="user-versus-application">user-versus-application</a> 
	problem.  Suppose you download a 
	viewer application from Redmond Pandemic, Inc., and run it.  At that
	point, that application can do just about anything that you could do
	using your account.  It can, for example

      <ul>
	<li>surreptitiously monitor what you view and report back to RPI,
	<li>steal your files, uploading them to the net,
	<li>erase your files,
	<li>make subtle modifications to your files, causing problems you may
	not detect for a long time,
	<li>install rogue applications (e.g., DDoS clients, password
	sniffers),
	<li>send threatening, incriminating, or libelous email,
	<li>make financial transactions on your behalf,
	<li>download incriminating files (e.g., child pornography) onto your
	computer,
	<li>etc., etc.
      </ul>

      Much of this you would probably detect eventually, and for some of these
      cases, you might have an action against RPI, assuming that you could
      pinpoint them as the cause and summon the resources to engage them
      legally.  In the mean time, though, you could suffer great, irreparable
      harm.

      <p>
	A related problem is the system administrator's dilemma one might call
	<a name="root-roulette"><em>root roulette</em></a>.  In this
	situation, the administrator must run 
	some program (e.g., an installation program) as root, thereby putting
	his entire system at the mercy of that program.  (This is disturbingly
	similar to the case of Windows users blithely executing "run me"
	programs they receive in their email.)

      <p>
	It is theoretically possible to run the root program safely by
	disconnecting the host from all networks (assuming the program doesn't
	need a network connection), and carefully comparing the state of all
	files before and after the program in question is run to ensure that
	nothing untoward was done.  This is, though, simply unworkable in
	practice.

      <p>
	So far, problems due to these shortcomings are relatively rare.  This
	may be due in part to *nix's limited use as a client OS up to this
	point.  But this respite won't last.

      <p>
	There are corporations, entities out there that don't see your
	computer as your property--they see <em>you</em>, or at least your
	behavior while running their software, as <em>their</em> property.  We
	see them pushing, stretching the boundaries all the time.  Increases
	in computing power and network bandwidth and changes in the political
	and legislative environment are making it all the more tempting for
	these entities to "borrow" part of your computer, and by extension
	part of <em>you</em>, for their purposes.
	  
      <p>
	<strong>The primary goal of SUBTERFUGUE is to help you keep control of
	your computer.</strong> It can do this not only by flagging and
	blocking errant application behavior, but also by allowing you to
	subvert the goals of the application in a more general way by
	controlling its reality.  It's not meant as a replacement for using
	free software, which is a key way for you to maintain control of your
	computer, but it can help you to detect perfidy and regain control
	over any software, free or not.

      <p>
	Computers exist to serve humanity--not the other way around.

      <p>
	SUBTERFUGUE exists to shift power back to where it belongs--to you.
